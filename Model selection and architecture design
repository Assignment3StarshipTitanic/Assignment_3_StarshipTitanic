Objective:

The goal of this step is to identify the most suitable machine learning models for predicting wheather a passenger was transported on the spaceship titanic.
The model had to balance accuracy, interpretability, training speed, and generalization.

Models under consideration:

Logistic regression - Simple, interpretable, and fast to train, may not be suitable or underperform for non-linear data.
XGBoost             - Complex, requires more tuning, can handle missing values, and shows complex interactions between data.
Random Forest       - Can handle non-linearity, large model size, less interpretable.
CatBoost            - Can handle Categorical features, longer training time.
SVM                 - Explored briefly, not ideal due to scale and interpretability issues.

Final model choices:
